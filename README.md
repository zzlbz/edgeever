EdgeEver is a modern, open-source notes and knowledge base workspace. It revives the beloved Evernote-style three-pane layout while offering an open data architecture and seamless AI Agent integration for complete ownership and smart productivity.

> 💡 **Serverless & 100% Free Forever**
> EdgeEver can run within Cloudflare's free quotas with no server purchase or VPS maintenance. Users who prefer a VPS, NAS, or home server can deploy the same application with Docker.

> ⭐ If EdgeEver is useful to you, consider giving it a Star. Your support helps more people discover the project.

## Why EdgeEver

Many long-time **Evernote** users simply want a **reliable, open, and fast** personal knowledge base. However, existing mainstream solutions all present tradeoffs:

* **Evernote**: A tool that accompanied the author for nearly a decade and holds the deepest affection. Yet as it evolved into a full-featured commercial suite, ads and add-ons multiplied while system overhead climbed. Meanwhile, free-tier quotas tightened, premium AI subscriptions grew expensive, and it remains difficult to integrate into modern self-hosted and private AI workflows.
* **Obsidian**: Open files, closed-source core. Official Sync is paid and third-party sync is tedious; relying entirely on flat local file scanning causes noticeable cold-start and search lag once notes reach thousands or heavy plugins are loaded; storing images and attachments alongside notes quickly bloats vaults, making mobile sync sluggish and leaving orphaned files behind; and it is overly heavy for lightweight, capture-anywhere use.
* **Memos & Stream Notes**: Clean and simple, but their social-timeline layouts differ fundamentally from the structured productivity of a classic three-pane workflow.
* **SiYuan & Block-based PKMs**: Powerful with self-hosting support, but their granular "block-level" architecture imposes noticeable cognitive overhead for quick daily capture and continuous prose writing. Furthermore, they lack a true zero-cost serverless deployment tier, and multi-device sync relies on paid official subscriptions or paying extra to unlock S3/WebDAV sync features with your own storage.

**EdgeEver fills this gap**: The entire stack is open source, including sync and self-hosting. It keeps the three-pane layout you know, stays silky-smooth and lightweight even with 10,000+ notes, and ships native AI agents with zero-cost deployment.

## Online Demo

## Deployment

Cloudflare is the recommended zero-server deployment. Docker is available for users who prefer a VPS, NAS, or home server.

For Cloudflare, choose either of the following online deployment options:

### Option A: Deploy with an AI Agent (Recommended)

Copy the prompt below directly into an AI Agent (such as Codex, Claude, Cursor, WorkBuddy, Antigravity, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, etc.). During execution, if access to GitHub or Cloudflare is required, review the requested permissions and follow the prompts to authorize access.

```text
Deploy EdgeEver entirely through GitHub and Cloudflare:
1. Fork https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever.
2. Create D1 `edgeever` and R2 `edgeever-resources` in Cloudflare.
3. In Workers & Pages, create a Worker named `edgeever` from the Fork's `main` branch.
   Use the repository root, keep Cloudflare's default Workers Builds deploy command,
   and ensure its API token can read and edit D1. Select Save and Deploy.
4. After the Worker is created, add the user's chosen password as the runtime Secret
   `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD` (preferably at least 32 characters).
   The username defaults to `admin`.
   If the user specifies another, set `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_USERNAME` as a Workers Builds
   variable before the next build.
5. Run the build again, verify `/api/health` and `/api/openapi.json`, then log in
   with that administrator username and password.
6. Enable and manually run the GitHub Actions workflow named `Update deployed EdgeEver`
   once so the Fork can automatically receive future stable releases and fixes.
```

> Detailed requirements: [AI Agent Cloudflare Deployment](docs/agent-deploy-cloudflare.md).

### Option B: Manual Online Deployment

Complete setup in 6 web steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click **Fork** at the top right of GitHub to fork EdgeEver into your personal account.
2. **Create Cloudflare Resources**: Create D1 `edgeever` and R2 `edgeever-resources`.
3. **Import & Configure the Project**: Create a Worker named `edgeever` from the Fork's `main` branch in Cloudflare **Workers & Pages**. Use the repository root and keep Cloudflare's default Workers Builds deploy command, which runs in Cloudflare. Ensure its API token can read and edit D1. The deploy command creates the bindings; do not edit Fork files.
4. **Choose the Administrator Password**: Choose an administrator password, preferably at least 32 characters. Once the Worker is created, save it as the runtime Secret `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD`.
5. **Build & Verify**: Save and Deploy creates the Worker and starts a build. If it fails because the administrator Secret is missing, add the runtime Secret from step 4 and retry. The username defaults to `admin`; to use another, set the `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_USERNAME` Workers Builds variable before retrying. Once deployed, confirm `/api/health` returns `200`, then log in with the configured username and password.
6. **Enable Automatic Updates**: Open the Fork's **Actions** tab, click **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**, then manually run **Update deployed EdgeEver** once so the Fork can automatically receive future stable releases and fixes.

> 📖 For full step-by-step instructions and configuration details, see the [Online Deployment Guide](docs/deploy-cloudflare-button.md).

> 💡 **Custom Domain & Access**: After deployment, you can directly use the default `*.workers.dev` domain assigned by Cloudflare, or attach your own custom domain in the Worker settings under **Settings → Domains & Routes**.

> 💡 **Cloudflare R2 Activation**: Although Cloudflare R2 offers a generous [free storage allowance](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/#free-tier) that note-taking workloads remain completely within, you must first activate an R2 subscription and add a payment method. Cloudflare [officially supports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/get-started/update-billing-info/#supported-payment-methods) UnionPay, Visa, Mastercard, and other cards, as well as PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other payment methods.

### Option C: Docker on a VPS or NAS

Use the GitHub-hosted installer and the official GHCR image:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://edgeever.org/install.sh | bash
```

The command pulls the latest image, generates an administrator password, and starts EdgeEver with Docker Compose.

See the [Docker deployment guide](docs/deploy-docker.md) for manual deployment and configuration.

After installation, updates run automatically each day by default. To update manually, run `~/edgeever/update.sh` on the deployment server.

---

## Multi-Account Login

Once deployed, a single instance supports multi-account login.

The instance administrator can create, disable, or reset member accounts in **Profile** -> **User accounts**. Each member gets a fully isolated personal workspace, including notebooks, notes, attachments, Trash, import/export, and MCP tokens.

```

## Content Formats

EdgeEver stores note content in three forms:

```text
content_json      TipTap/ProseMirror document, the editor source of truth
content_markdown  API, Agent, import, and export format
content_text      Search, summary, and indexing text
```

Open **Profile** -> **Import and export** to export or import an EdgeEver ZIP. Its `notes/` directory is directly readable and portable as Markdown, while its structured data supports complete recovery between EdgeEver instances. Import preserves unrelated target data and overwrites records with matching EdgeEver IDs.

## MCP

Create an API token in **Profile** -> **API / MCP** and copy the Remote MCP configuration in one click to let AI Agents such as Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, and OpenClaw securely manage your knowledge base within account permissions. EdgeEver supports full CRUD for text notes, visual diagram notes (mind maps, flowcharts, and architecture diagrams), and structured table notes. Agents can also manage notebook hierarchies, tags, attachments, revision history, note templates, and AI instructions.

> 💡 **Inspiration:**
> Make AI your true knowledge orchestrator and creative co-pilot—instantly turn concepts into interactive mind maps, flowcharts, architecture diagrams, and structured tables, while supplying private context to your AI Agents. Paired with EdgeEver’s powerful rich-text editing and elegant typography, AI-assisted content becomes beautifully structured, polished, and publication-ready knowledge assets.

## Image Compression

Image compression happens in the Web client before upload and is controlled by the **Compress note images** setting. When enabled, PNG, JPEG, WebP, and AVIF files are converted to WebP when beneficial, with the longest edge limited to `2560px`. If compression does not reduce size, the original file is kept.

EdgeEver avoids Worker-side image processing to reduce compute and image-processing quota usage. REST API and MCP upload paths store the file content provided by the client without additional server-side compression.

## Advanced Object Storage

The instance owner can configure S3-compatible object storage under **Settings → Advanced → OSS object storage**. Changing storage does not migrate or affect existing attachments.

## Migration

If you want to migrate notes from other platforms to EdgeEver, please refer to the following simple migration guides:

- **Evernote Migration**: Please refer to [docs/evernote-migration-guide.md](docs/evernote-migration-guide.md)
- **flomo Migration**: Please refer to [docs/flomo-migration-guide.md](docs/flomo-migration-guide.md)
- **Memos Migration**: Please refer to [docs/memos-migration-guide.md](docs/memos-migration-guide.md)
- **Notion Migration**: Please refer to [docs/notion-migration-guide.md](docs/notion-migration-guide.md)

## Docker Deployment

Docker runs the same frontend, API routes, services, authentication, MCP implementation, and migrations as Cloudflare. The container uses SQLite with local files or S3-compatible attachment storage and supports `amd64` and `arm64`. See [Deploy EdgeEver with Docker](docs/deploy-docker.md) and [Self-hosting and Docker architecture](docs/self-hosting-architecture.md).

## Sync Timing

Web, PWA, and desktop upload memo edits after 30 seconds of inactivity and check for remote changes every 5 minutes while visible; focus and manual refresh remain immediate. Adjust `DEFERRED_MEMO_SYNC_DELAY_MS` and `BACKGROUND_WORKSPACE_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS` in [`apps/web/src/lib/workspace-refresh.ts`](apps/web/src/lib/workspace-refresh.ts).
