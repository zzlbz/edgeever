# Visual Diagram Notes Design

EdgeEver has two graphic-note paths: mind maps, flowcharts, and architecture diagrams use `DiagramDocument`; infographics use AntV Infographic syntax. They are stored separately and are not converted automatically.

## Diagram notes

`DiagramDocument` is the source of truth for editable diagrams. It stores nodes, edges, necessary layout, and semantics rather than X6 view state. `kind` distinguishes `mind-map`, `flowchart`, and `architecture`; `schemaVersion` governs format changes. Architecture boundaries and connection types, along with mind-map hierarchy, are part of the document.

Web and desktop edit with AntV X6. Android, iOS, and public shares render the same IR read-only. A Base64URL-encoded IR lives in the persisted Markdown's `edgeever-diagram-v1` comment. The Mermaid diagram in the body supports reading outside EdgeEver and fallback when IR parsing fails; it is not the editing canvas. Mermaid code blocks in ordinary notes are a separate feature.

Parsing and validation live in [`diagram.ts`](../packages/shared/src/diagram.ts), semantic compilation and layout in [`diagram-layout.ts`](../packages/shared/src/diagram-layout.ts), and cross-platform read-only rendering in [`diagram-view.ts`](../packages/shared/src/diagram-view.ts). Native apps remain read-only until they can safely edit the same IR.

## Infographics

An infographic is a separate note type whose source is AntV Infographic's declarative syntax. The syntax directly holds its template, theme, and data. `InfographicDocument` stores it in an `edgeever-infographic-v1` comment; EdgeEver does not duplicate those fields in another generic IR. Each note type has its own parser.

Presenting a diagram note through Infographic would require an explicit `DiagramDocument → Infographic` conversion that identifies lost layout or interaction data. Existing notes should not be migrated until a bidirectional mapping is validated.

## AI and MCP

Diagram AI and MCP accept a coordinate-free semantic graph, which the server validates and lays out. `create_diagram_memo` creates a diagram note, `get_diagram` reads its semantic graph, and `update_diagram` applies incremental changes with `expectedRevision` to prevent overwrites. Its default `reflow=preserve` keeps existing layout; `reflow=all` is reserved for an explicitly requested full relayout. The generic `update_memo` does not directly replace diagram content.

Infographic AI selects an AntV template and generates matching data; people can refine text on the canvas. Each path retains its own source of truth instead of persisting a rendered result.
