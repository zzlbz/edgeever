## ⌨️ 4. Power Productivity Toolbox: Slash Commands, Backlinks & Math

### 🪄 Slash Commands
Type `/` or press `Space` on an empty line to invoke the command menu:
- Insert `H1/H2/H3` headings, quotes, horizontal rules, code blocks, and rich tables;
- Use `/date`, `/time`, or `/now` to insert current timestamps instantly;
- Attach files, insert images, or summon the inline AI assistant.

### 🔗 Bi-directional Note Links & Backlinks
Type `@` or insert `#memo=<memoId>` links to establish bi-directional references across your knowledge base, building an interconnected web of thoughts.

### 📐 KaTeX Professional LaTeX Mathematics
Native support for KaTeX renders complex mathematical equations in milliseconds:

- **Inline Math**: For instance, Einstein's mass-energy equivalence $E = mc^2$ or the Gaussian probability density function $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$.
- **Display Block Math**:
$$
\oint_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0} \iiint_{\Omega} \rho \, dV, \quad \oint_{\partial \Omega} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0
$$

    participant Database as Notion / Feishu Bitable

    User->>Client: Capture quick spark or meeting notes
    Agent->>MCP: tools/call memo_search (Query unprocessed memos)
    MCP-->>Agent: Returns structured Markdown & tags
    Agent->>Agent: Analyzes content, extracts key takeaways & tags
    Agent->>MCP: tools/call memo_update (Writes back summary & tags)
    Agent->>Database: Syncs structured records to master database
    Client-->>User: Sub-second live updates in client UI
```
